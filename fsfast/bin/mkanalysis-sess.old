BEGINHELP

This program creates an 'analysis'. An analysis is a concept within the 
FS-FAST processing stream framework. The analysis is meant to be a 
placeholder for all the within-session processing options (eg, motion 
correction, spatial smoothing, event-type definition, etc). As such, 
the parameters apply to ALL sessions (ie, it does not need to be run 
separately for each session), and does not depend upon the data in any 
one session. This program should be run from your FS-FAST Study 
Directory. This program only configures the analysis; it does not 
analyze the data (see selxavg-sess or sfa-sess). 

 
ARGUMENTS AND FLAGS: 

-analysis analysisname (Shortcut: -a) 

This is the name given to the analysis. A folder called analysisname 
will be created in the Study Directory. Two files (analysis.info and 
analysis.cfg) will be created in this directory. The analysis 
parameters will be stored in these files. Contrast matrices (created 
by mkcontrast-sess) will also be stored in this directory. When the 
session data are analyzed with selxavg-sess or sfa-sess data, a folder 
called analysisname will be created in the functional subdirectory 
(FSD), and the results of the analysis will be placed there.  

-TR TR 
 
This is the TR in seconds. It will be checked against the TR in each 
session when selxavg-sess is run. See also -TER. 
 
-paradigm parname (Shortcut: -p) 
 
This is the name of the paradigm file as found in each functional run 
directory. For blocked and event-related designs, the paradigm file 
defines which event type was presented when. For periodic designs 
(retinotopy and AB blocked), it defines the phase and period of 
stimulation for each run. The name of the paradigm file must be the 
same across runs and sessions, though its contents can change. 
If event types are redefined (eg, post-hoc event sorting), then a 
new paradigm file (with a different name) should be created followed 
by creating a new analysis. For event and blocked designs, time=0 
is relative to the time of acquisition of the first stored image. 
 
-designtype type (Shortcut: -dt) 
 
This specifies the type of design for which the analysis is being 
created. Legal values are event-related, blocked, abblocked, and 
retinotopy. Event-related and blocked must be analyzed with 
selxavg-sess. abblocked and retinotopy must be analyzed with 
sfa-sess. abblocked is a block design in which only two conditions (or 
one condition and one null condition) are presented in a periodic 
fashion. Ie, each condition is presented for for the same duration in 
an alternating fashion. 
 
-fsd FSD 
 
Functional subdirectory (FSD). This is the folder under the sessions 
directory in which the runs of raw functional data will be found 
(default is bold). 
 
-funcstem stem 
 
This is the bshort/bfloat stem of the functional volume to process. This 
volume must exist in each functional run. By default, the stem is f. 
If the -motioncor flag is included, then the stem fmc is used (this is 
the default output of mc-sess). 
 
-runlistfile filename (Shortcut: -rlf) 

This is a file that should exist in each FSD that lists the runs to be 
processed in that session. The name must be the same across sessions 
but the contents of each file can vary. If an RLF is not specified, 
all runs found in the FSD will be processed. 
 
-no-inorm 

Do not perform intensity normalization default is to
apply it. Intensity normalization will force the grand within-tissue
mean of the functional data to be 100 for each run (note that
prior to version 5 the rescale factor was 1000). This uses the
global.meanval.dat produced by mkbrainmask-sess

-nskip N 
 
Skip the first N time points in each functional run. It may be 
necessary to eliminate the first 4 or 5 time points in a functional 
run because the sample has not reached magnetic equilibrium. This is 
usually not necessary if the sample was scanned with discarded 
acquisitions (DISTACQS or DDAs). Note: the nskip does not affect the 
definition of time=0 in the paradigm file (see -paradigm). This  
functionality can also be implemented using a time-point exclude file  
(see -tpef). 
 
-tpef filename 
 
This is the name of a time point exclude file (TPEF). The TPEF stores 
a list of times (in seconds) of time points to exclude from the 
analysis. The TPEF must be found in the run directory with the functional 
data to which it applies. Like paradigm files, the TPEFs must have the  
same name across subjects and runs though their contents can differ.  
Unlike paradigm files, it is not necessary to have a TPEF in each run; 
if no TPEF is found, no time points are excluded. 
 
-polyfit N

Drift removal. Fit and remove polynomial of order N. Default is 1
(ie, 0=mean, 1=linear, and 2=quadradic). 

-autostimdur (-noautostimdur)

Automatically compute the duration of each stimulus based on the time
between stimuli in the paradigm file. This allows for stimuli to be of
different lengths. It requires that all stimuli be accounted for in
the paradigm file (eg, fixation). It also requires that no stimuli
overlap.  -noautostimdur tells the program NOT to compute the
stimulus duration from the paradigm file, in which case it assumes
that the stimuli duration has a length equal to the TR (or TER). This
used to be the default (pre 12/4/06). Now you must specify what you
are going to use. This only applies to event-related and abblocked
paradigms.

-nconditions Nc (Shortcut: -nc) 
 
(For blocked and event-related designs). This is the number of 
conditions as found in the paradigm files. When selxavg-sess runs, it 
checks the number of conditions found the paradigm files against Nc 
and returns an error if they differ. 
 
-timewindow TimeWindow (Shortcut: -tw) 

(For blocked and event-related designs). If no shape to the
hemodynamic response is to be assumed (ie, -gammafit and -spmhrf are
not used), then this is the amount of time needed to capture the
entire event and response, including a prestimulus window. Here, for
blocked designs, the event refers to the entire block. If a shape to
the hemodynamic response will be assumed (ie, -gammafit is used), then
the time window should be long enough to capture the gamma
function. In this case, there is no penalty for a long time window. If
no time window is selected with -gammafit or -spmhrf, 40 sec is used.

-extreg extreg nextreg

Use external regressors when doing estimation. The external regressors
can be stored as a simple text file with a row for each time point
in the functional. There can be any number of columns. "nextreg" 
indicates how many columns to use. To use all the columns, set 
nextreg to -1. Multiple external regressor files can be specified.

-mcextreg

Use motion parameters as external regressors. This is the same as
setting "-extreg mcextreg 3". mcextreg is created when
running mc-sess by orthognalizing the motion parameters. Only the top
three components are used.

-prestim PreStimTimeWindow (Shortcut: -ps) 

(For blocked and event-related designs). Start averaging
PreStimTimeWindow seconds before the onset of the stimulus. This only
applies to analyses in which the no shape to the hemodynamic response
is to be assumed (ie, -gammafit and -spmhrf are not used).

-gammafit gfDelta gfTau 

(For blocked and event-related designs). Assume that the hemodynamic 
response takes the shape of a gamma function. gfDelta is the hemodynamic 
delay (ie, the time until the onset of the response), and gfTau is the 
dispersion, which controls the rise and fall times. Both are specified 
in seconds. gfAlpha is the exponent for the gamma function (see
-gammaexp); for BOLD, alpha=2. The gamma function takes the form:  

         f(t) = ((t-delta)/tau)^alpha * exp(-(t-delta)/tau) 

-gammaexp gfAlpha

Exponent for the gamma function. Default is 2, which tends to fit the 
BOLD hemodynamic response better.

-spmhrf nderiv

Assume that the hemodynamic response takes the shape of a the SPM HRF
function (see www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). This is a difference of two
gamma functions which includes an post-stimulus undershoot. For
blocked and event-related designs.

-taumax TauMax 
 
(For blocked and event-related designs). This instructs selxavg-sess  
to estimate and correct for global autocorrelation in the noise. It 
will assume that the autocorrelation function is zero beyond a delay 
of TauMax seconds. 

-acfbins nbins 

Spatially segment the brain into nbins within the mask for the
purposes of computing separate autocorrelation/whitening functions. 
Default is 10. This only affects to selxavg3-sess. Set to 0 to
turn off whitening (or use -no-whiten).

-no-fix-acf

Do not correct the autocorrelation function because of the estimation 
from residuals.

-mask maskid

This only applies when using -taumax. This is a mask (as found in
bold/masks) that is used to limit the voxels used in the computation
of the whitening fillter. Usually, one would run  mkbrainmask-sess
to create masks/brain, and then specify brain as maskid.
 
-TER TemporalEstimationResolution 

(For event-related designs). The TER is the Temporal Estimation
Resolution. This is the resolution to which the hemodynamic response
will be estimated (in seconds) for FIR analyses. It must be an integer
divisor of the TR. If TER < TR, then stimulus schedule (ie, paradigm
file) must have been created with with the given TER in mind. If 
-spmhrf or -gammafit are used, then it is automatically set to TR/20.

-refeventdur Duration

For assumed shapes to the HRF (ie, non-FIR designs), this is the
Duration (sec) of your events. This is strictly used for scaling of
the signal change values so that the percent change reported will be
similar to the signal change you would see if you looked at the raw
data. It will have NO effect on significance values. If you have a
design with multiple durations, you should pick one as the reference.
Note that this does not effect comparisons between long and short
duration stimuli because it does not affect the p-value.

-timeoffset toffset 
 
(For blocked and event-related designs). The time to add to the times 
listed in each paradigm file. This is only useful if, for some 
reason, each paradigm file if off by the same amount. This may happen 
if there was a systematic delay between the beginning of the stimulus 
stream and the beginning of scanning. 
 
-ncycles N 
 
(For retinotopy and AB blocked designs). For designs in which the 
stimuli are presented periodically, this is the number of cycles 
of stimulation presented in each run.
