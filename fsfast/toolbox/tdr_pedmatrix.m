% Computes the EPI post-excitation delay (PED) of each sample in a
% k-space image.  The row/col in the PED matrix corresponds to that of
% the kspace image without any reversals (readout or phase encode)
% applied. Any such operations applied to the kspace image should then
% be applied to the PED matrix. It is assumed that the even lines were
% acquired in reverse readout.
%
% The perev indicates that k-space was traversed in the reverse
% phase encode direction. This changes where the center of k-space is
% in the PED matrix. No reversals or flipping of the PED matrix are
% applied even when the perev is set. The upper left voxel in the
% PED matrix will always have the shortest PED because that was
% the first voxel to be acquired. Setting perev has a subtle
% effect. It only shifts the sample times so that the center of
% k-space is at nrows/2-1 instead of nrows/2+1.
%
% TE - echo time - time at which the center of k-space is traversed.
% echospacing - time between lines/echoes
% delsamp - time to first sample after the start of the ramp
% tDwell - time between ADC samples
% nrows - number of rows in the raw k-space image
% ncols - number of columns in the raw k-space image (includes oversampling)
% perev - k-space was traversed in the reverse direction (PED
%           matrix is not flipped UD). If perev is not given or is
%           empty, no reversal is assumed.
