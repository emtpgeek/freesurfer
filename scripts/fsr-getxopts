# fsr-getxopts
#
# USAGE: fsr-getxopts cmd xoptsfile
#
# Parses expert options for freesurfer recon.
# Looks in xoptsfile for a line with cmd as the first item,
# then returns the rest of the items on that line. Ignores
# all lines with # in them, regardless of where on the line
# they occur.
#
# Eg, if the file expert.opts contains:
#   mri_em_register -p .5
# Then
#   fsr-getxopts mri_em_register expert.opts
# will return
#   -p .5
