// The SSE terms are either computed by iterating over the vertices or the faces
// Ideally there would be one pass over each, to 
//      a) minimize the scanning logic
//      b) minimize the cache traffic
// Furthermore it would be more efficient to do these using the dense MRIS_MP format rather than the MRIS format
// We are working towards this ideal...
//
// For now, only the terms used in recon-all bert have been moved here
// The rest will follow
